## 🚨 **IMMEDIATE SETUP REQUIRED**

### 1. **Configure Stripe Webhooks** (Critical)

Your webhooks code is working, but you need to:

```bash
# 1. Add webhook secret to Railway:
railway variables set STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_production_key_here

# 2. In Stripe Dashboard, add webhook endpoint:
# URL: https://your-app.railway.app/api/stripe/webhooks
# Events: checkout.session.completed, customer.subscription.updated,
#         invoice.payment_succeeded, customer.subscription.deleted, invoice.payment_failed
```

### 2. **Test the Payment Flow**

```bash
# Your payment API is live and ready:
curl -X POST https://your-app.railway.app/api/stripe/create-checkout-session \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"plan": "pro", "interval": "monthly"}' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <clerk-session-token>"
```
